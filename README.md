Eye-Like Reaction-Diffusion Pattern with Camera Integration (Executable)
This program simulates an eye-like reaction-diffusion pattern while blending the simulation with a real-time camera feed. The graphical interface is powered by Pygame, and the camera feed is handled using OpenCV. The pattern is generated using the reaction-diffusion model, and users can interact with the simulation to generate new random patterns.

Features
Real-time reaction-diffusion simulation combined with a live camera feed.
User-friendly interface with a "Generate" button to create random patterns.
Scalable window size with automatic adjustment of the simulation.
Pause and resume functionality.
System Requirements
To run this executable, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

Windows, macOS, or Linux.
A functional camera (if you want to use the camera blending feature).
No need to install Python or external libraries, as the program is self-contained.
How to Run the Executable
Download the executable file provided.
Double-click the file to launch the program.
The program will open a window with the reaction-diffusion simulation and your camera feed.
Generate New Pattern: Click the "Generate" button at the bottom-right of the window.
Pause/Resume Simulation: Press the space bar to pause or resume the pattern evolution.
Resize Window: You can resize the window, and the program will adjust the patterns accordingly.
